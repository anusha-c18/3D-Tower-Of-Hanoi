Once you open this project, you can view all the assets that I have used to create the game and more. This game was made in a days time hence the code isn't optimized. You can make changes to the script as a lot of the code has been repeated and can be placed in methods instead. That being said, the code works perfectly fine, just the way it is as well. The terrain was a simple one and we were meant to add an Eskimo avatar to the game who prompts rules and hints based on the player's actions. We were going to create and animate the eskimo's avatar using Blender.
